Project 1. NYSE Data analysis using Excel
Created a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list (using data validation, OFFSET, INDEX and MATCH Functions) to pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statements for all the years. Created a dynamic financial forecasting model for a company that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios.
